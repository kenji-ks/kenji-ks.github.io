As someone whose first introduction to coding was code.org, I had to get used to JavaScript early on in my computer science journey. Since it was my first language, it took me a while to understand it, and I never really understood what it was capable of until high school. In my senior year of high school, I began using JavaScript a little for web development. My overall experience with JavaScript has been relatively positive, and seeing JavaScript in TypeScript has been like seeing a familiar face in a crowd full of the languages I have learned in college. Seeing a coding language that was not completely foreign to me was nice.

## Relearning How to Walk
Before taking this course, the last time I had used JavaScript was in my senior year of high school. My understanding of JavaScript was limited since I only used it when necessary, but knowing something about it made learning TypeScript easier for me. However, since my JavaScript skills were pretty rusty, I made the same mistakes I used to make with JavaScript in elementary school with TypeScript. It took a while for me to shake off the rust, but relearning JavaScript by learning how to use TypeScript felt nostalgic and enjoyable for me. It was a lot easier for me to get used to TypeScript than with other languages.

## TypeScript vs. The Others

Compared to programming languages that I have learned already, I feel like I enjoy coding with TypeScript a little more than other languages. I struggled with understanding Python since Python's coding style and rules felt completely foreign to me. While I ended ICS212 with a fairly good understanding of C and C++, learning how pointers and references worked was difficult for me. While HTML was one of the easier languages that I have learned, CSS was much harder for me to understand. Compared to these languages, I definitely prefer TypeScript. I feel that, from a software engineering perspective, TypeScript is a good programming language.

## On Athletic Software Engineering

Athletic software engineering is a form of learning that I was not familiar with at all. I never really had to code with a time limit under two hours, so having to complete a task in ten to twenty minutes was scary for me initially. However, the WODs are pretty manageable, and I actually kind of enjoyed doing them. I found the practice WODs to be very useful in getting me warmed up with TypeScript, and I have enjoyed this learning style so far. It can be a little stressful, but it has been pretty enjoyable so far, and I feel that it will work for me with enough practice.
