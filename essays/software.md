## Uncharted Territory

I knew little to nothing about software engineering until fairly recently. All I knew was that apps, web browsers, and games were software applications. I knew nothing about how they were designed or what happens behind the scenes when a software program is being designed. Unlike TypeScript, where I had a decent background thanks to my knowledge of JavaScript, I knew little to nothing about what software engineering is like. However, I enjoy challenging myself and am interested in learning software engineering. Since cybersecurity is my main interest, and because I do not yet know what goes on behind the scenes, learning about software engineering would help me if I find out that I enjoy cybersecurity more than cybersecurity.

## Into the Future

I hope to improve my understanding of the languages involved in software engineering. I want to leave this class with a much better understanding of TypeScript. I want to be able to apply my knowledge of JavaScript and TypeScript to create software effectively and efficiently. In the future, I would like to understand how to plan for and develop software based on someone's requests. Overall, I want to learn more about software engineering as a job and get tips on developing software.

## Developing Experience

I want to experience more of what software engineering is like in professional settings. I want to understand how work is divided and how an average workday goes to better understand what I might be getting into. I would also like to develop better programming habits to code and plan projects more efficiently. My only experience with something software engineering-related was code.org, so I want to experience more of the real-world situations that software engineers go through daily. There are many different aspects of software engineering that I want to learn more about, and I hope that I'll be able to say that I understand software engineering entirely sometime in the future.
