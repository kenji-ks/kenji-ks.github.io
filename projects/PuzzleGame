I developed a small puzzle game where users must click on a particular part of the website to progress to the next one. I used HTML and CSS to create, edit, and animate websites to make the game playable. The game's goal was to click on the one aspect of the website that didn't fit in. For example, I animated a connect-4 game, and users had to click on one coin that fell differently than the others to progress. 

I also created a fake school website where users had to look through every dropdown box to see which link was wrong. The game was small, and there were only six levels with six different websites, but it gave me a decent understanding of the basics of HTML and CSS.
