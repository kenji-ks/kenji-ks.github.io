I created a text-based RPG running on Java and user input. I made a map for this game by creating a labyrinth-like map using Xs and Os. The goal of the game is to make your way through as many floors of the labyrinth as possible. Every map is randomly generated, with the length and width of the maps also being random. As users walked through the maze, I created random encounters where users could use their character to fight enemies. I set up a system for stat allocation and levels to make this more interesting.

When the game is run, users are put through a short tutorial with a small map to get used to controlling the character. This tutorial also involved random encounters and how to allocate stats, which was important since I made random encounters progressively more difficult. After every run, users were shown a leaderboard to compare their scores with their previous scores.
